# OPENVPN PROFILE LOGIN NOTIFICATION SYSTEM
<h2>
This program written in Python allows users to track client logins on a server that is running OpenVPN. This program uses Discord Webhooks to send alerts when an OpenVPN Client profile is activated. When a profile establishes a successful connection to the OpenVPN server it sends the profile name and the IP Address associated with it to the webhook and it will also log all the information into a .txt file.
